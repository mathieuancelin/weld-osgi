/**
 * <p>This interface represents the registrations of an injectable service in the
 * service registry. Its behavior is similar to {@link Service}, thus
 * it might represent the iterable set of all the registrations of a
 * service.</p>
 * <p>It allows to:<ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>Wrap a list of service registration (i.e. the bindings between a
 * service and its implementations) as an {@link Iterable} java
 * object,</p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>Select a subset of these registration filtered by
 * {@link javax.inject.Qualifier}s or LDAP filters,</p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>Iterate through these service registrations,</p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>Obtain the service implementations list as a
 * {@link Service},</p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>Get the number of registrations (i.e the number of registered
 * service implementations).</p>
 * </li>
 * </ul></p>
 * <p>OSGi services should not be subtyped.</p>
