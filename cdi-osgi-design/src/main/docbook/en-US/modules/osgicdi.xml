        <title>API bundles, extension bundle and integration bundle</title>
        <para>CDI-OSGi is composed of five bundles: <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The API bundles that provides the API used to define both utilities
                        provided and hooking up system with implementation bundle,</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The extension bundle that provides CDI-OSGi features for bean bundles by
                        managing them,</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>An integration bundle that provides CDI features usable by the extension
                        bundle through an OSGi service.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Note that as CDI-OSGi runs in an OSGi environment it is implicit that there is an OSGi
            core bundle too. This one provide OSGi features for all other bundles, including
            CDI-OSGi managed bundles. But it is not an actual part of CDI-OSGi.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Extension API, integration API and CDI API</title>
            <para>Three API bundles expose all packages that could be needed by developers; both for
                client application using CDI-OSGi and for CDI compliant container integration. They
                may be use as a dependency for bean bundles, extension bundle and implementation
                bundle.</para>
            <para>These three distinct API are: <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The extension API that describes all the new features provided by
                            CDI-OSGi in the OSGi environment.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The integration API that allows CDI compliant container to be used
                            with CDI-OSGi.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The CDI API that describes all the regular CDI features provided by
                            CDI-OSGi to bean bundles.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist></para>
            <para>These three API are more described below.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Extension API</title>
                <para>The extension API defines all the features provided to OSGi environment using
                    CDI specification. It exposes all the new utilities and defines the comportment
                    of the extension bundle.</para>
                <para>It exposes all the interfaces, events and annotations usable by a developers
                    in order to develop its client bean bundles. It defines the programming model of
                    CDI-OSGi client bundle. Mostly it is about publishing and consuming injectable
                    services in a CDI way.</para>
                <para>It also describes the object the extension bundle needs to orchestrate bean
                    bundles.</para>
                <para>So this is where to search for new usages of OSGi.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Integration API</title>
                <para>The integration API defines how a CDI container, such as Weld, should
                    bootstrap with the CDI OSGi extension. So any CDI environment implementation
                    could use the CDI OSGi extension transparently. The CDI compliant container may
                    be provided using an implementation bundle.</para>
                <para>This aims at providing the minimum integration in order to start a CDI
                    compliant container with every managed bean bundle. Then the extension bundle
                    can get a CDI container to provide to every one of its manages bean
                    bundle.</para>
                <para>Moreover the integration API allows to mix CDI compliant container in the same
                    application by providing an embedded mode. In this mode a bean bundle is
                    decoupled from the extension bundle and is managed on its own. Thus various
                    implementations of CDI container can be used or the behavior of a particular
                    bean bundle can be particularized.</para>
                <para>All this bootstrapping mechanism works using the service layer of OSGi. A CDI
                    compliant implementation bundle may provide a service that allows the extension
                    bundle to obtain a new container for every bean bundle.</para>
                <para>So this is where to search to make CDI-OSGi use a specific CDI compliant
                    container.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>CDI API</title>
                <para>The CDI API is described by the CDI specifications. It is provided with
                    CDI-OSGi and defines all the CDI features usable in bean bundles.</para>
                <para>This API will not be describe furthermore as it would be redundant with CDI
                    specifications.</para>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Extension bundle: the puppet master</title>
            <para>The extension bundle is the orchestrator of CDI-OSGi. It may be use by any
                application that requires CDI-OSGi. It may be just started at the begining of a
                CDI-OSGi application. It requests the APIs bundle as a dependency.</para>
            <para>The extension bundle is the heart of CDI-OSGi application. Once it is started,
                provided that it finds a started implementation bundle, it manages all the bean
                bundles. It is in charge of service automatic publishings, service injections, CDI
                event notifications and bundle communications.</para>
            <para>It runs in background, it just need to be started with the OSGi environment, then
                everything is transparent to the user. Client bean bundles do not have to do
                anything in order to use CDI-OSGi functionality.</para>
            <para>In order to perform injections the extension bundle search for a CDI compliant
                container service provider once it is started. Thus it can only work coupled with a
                bundle providing such a service: an implementation bundle.</para>
            <para>So this is where the magic happens and where OSGi applications become much more
                simple.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Implementation bundle: choose a CDI compliant container</title>
            <para>The implementation bundle is responsible for providing CDI compliant containers to
                the extension bundle. It may be started with the extension bundle and publish the
                right service. It request the APIs bundle as a dependency.</para>
            <para>It is an implementation of the integration API, thus it may provide a CDI
                container factory service.</para>

            <para>The diagram above shows how CDI-OSGi bundles are linked together. The blue part is
                the core of OSGi and is provided. The red part is a required but interchangeable
                bundle.</para>
            <para>All together these three bundle make CDI-OSGi. Then CDI-OSGi functionalities are
                exposed to bean bundles and an OSGi extension is provided in order to manage these
                bean bundles.</para>

            <para>CDI-OSGi provides an extension to OSGi as an extender pattern. The extension
                bundle, the extender, tracks for bean bundles, the extensions, to be started. Then
                CDI utilities are enabled for these bean bundles over OSGi environment.</para>

        <title>A standard bootstrap for CDI container integration: the integration API</title>
        <section>
            <title>Why an integration API</title>
            <para>CDI-OSGi could have been carried out with an internal CDI compliant container and
                work very well. Every one of the specifications above would have been fulfilled. But
                no other specific utilities or CDI evolution could have been added without a
                complete modification of CDI-OSGi.</para>
            <para>Then there is the integration API. With that, developers are able to provide their
                own implementation bundle. Thus it is possible to use any CDI compliant container
                with a CDI-OSGi application or mix up different CDI compliant containers for
                different bundles.</para>
            <para>Integration API describe what needs the extension bundle to work (and therefore
                what may provide the implementation bundle) and what provides the extension bundle
                (and therefore what should use the implementation bundle).</para>
            <section>
                <title>The <code>BundleContainer</code> and <code>BundleContainers</code>

}</programlisting>
                <para>These interfaces represent the CDI compliant containers used by bean bundle.
                    Such container may be accessible in the OSGi application to provide an event
                    notification system.</para>
                <para>Multiple containers can be manipulated by the <code>BundleContainers</code>
                    interface.</para>

}</programlisting>
                <para>This the how the extension bundle require a CDI compliant container from the
                    implementation bundle. This latter should publish an OSGi service that complies
                    with this interface.</para>

        <title>The life of a bean bundle</title>
        <para>This section presents the lifecycle of a bean bundle and how it impacts CDI and OSGi
            regular behaviors. Mostly bean bundles follow the same lifecycle than a regular bundle.
            There are only two new possible states and they do not modify the behavior from OSGi
            side.</para>
        <figure>
            <title>The bean bundle lifecycle</title>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="../images/Beanbundlestate.png" align="center" format="PNG"
                        width="800" depth="600"/>
                </imageobject>
                <caption>This figure shows the two new states a bean bundle can be in. These states
                    are triggered by two new events and address the CDI container dependency
                    resolution (i.e. services annotated @Required).</caption>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>The regular OSGi lifecycle is not modified by the new CDI-OSGi states as they have the
            same meaning than the ACTIVE state from an OSGi point of view. They only add information
            about the validation of required service availability.</para>

        <title>How to make a bundle or a bean archive a bean bundle</title>
        <para>There are very few things to do in order to obtain a bean bundle from a bean archive
            or a bundle. Mostly it is just adding the missing marker files and headers in the
            archive: <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para> Make a bean archive a bean bundle by adding special OSGi marker headers
                        in its <code>META-INF/Manifest.MF</code> file.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para> Or, in the other way, make a bundle a bean bundle by adding a
                            <code>META-INF/bean.xml</code> file.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Thus a bean bundle has both <code>META-INF/bean.xml</code> file and OSGi marker
            headers in its <code>META-INF/Manifest.MF</code> file.</para>
        <para>However there is a few other information that CDI-OSGi might need in order to perform
            a correct extension. In particular a bean bundle can not be manage by the extension
            bundle but by his own embedded CDI container. For that there is a new manifest
            header.</para>
        <section>
            <title>The <code>META-INF/bean.xml</code> file </title>
            <para>The beans.xml file follows no particular rules and should be the same as in a
                native CDI environment. Thus it can be completely empty or declare interceptors,
                decorators or alternatives as a regular CDI beans.xml file.</para>
            <para>There will be no different behavior with a classic bean archive except for CDI
                OSGi extension new utilities. But these don't need any modification on the
                    <code>META-INF/bean.xml</code> file.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The Embedded-CDIContainer <code>META-INF/Manifest.MF</code> header </title>
            <para>This header prevents the extension bundle to automatically manage the bean bundle
                that set this manifest header to true. So the bean bundle can be manage more finely
                by the user or use a different CDI container. If this header is set to false or is
                not present in the <code>META-INF/Manifest.MF</code> file then the bean bundle will
                be automatically manage by the extension bundle (if it is started).</para>
